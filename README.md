This project aims to address the challenge of predictive maintenance in the context of engine performance. The goal is to develop machine learning models that can accurately identify engines with potential problems based on various sensor readings and parameters.

The dataset used for this project consists of historical data collected from engines, including features such as engine RPM, fuel pressure, lubricating oil pressure, coolant temperature, coolant pressure, and lubricating oil temperature. Each engine in the dataset is labeled as either having a problem or being in a normal operating condition.

The key objectives of this project are as follows:

Preprocessing the data and handling any missing or outlier values.
Exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the distribution and relationships of the features.
Implementing machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Random Forest, and XGBoost, to predict engine problems.
Evaluating the performance of the models using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and ROC AUC.
Fine-tuning the models using grid search and cross-validation techniques to optimize their hyperparameters.
Addressing the issue of class imbalance using techniques such as SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) and random undersampling.
Assessing the feature importance to identify the key factors contributing to engine problems.
Providing a comprehensive analysis of the results and recommendations for further improvement.
By developing accurate predictive maintenance models, this project aims to help identify engines at risk of failure, enabling timely maintenance and reducing operational downtime and costs.
